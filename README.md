- Linked Lists (single / double)  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Priority Queues  
- Hash Tables  
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST, etc.)  
- Heaps  
- Graph representations  

### ✔ Algorithms
- Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort)  
- Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)  
- Recursion & Divide-and-Conquer  
- Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS)  
- Tree Traversal (Inorder / Preorder / Postorder)  

### ✔ Course Materials Included

## 🛠 How to Use

### Compile all `.java` files:
```
javac *.java
```

Run an individual Java program:

```java FileName```

(Adjust paths depending on the folder structure.)

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Consolidate all course-related data structure code  
- Provide clean reference implementations  
- Serve as a study resource for exams or technical interviews  
- Build foundational Java programming skills
